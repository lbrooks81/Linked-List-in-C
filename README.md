# Linked List in C++

Specifications

C++ is a great language to demonstrate linked lists. This is because C++ has built-in pointers, which
makes node traversal natural. Implement the LinkedListBase, the SinglyLinkedList, and
DoublyLinkedList classes.

Because there will be an abstract class, utilize pure virtual functions, similar to the last C++ lab with
inheritance.

Make sure all three classes allow generic types.

Constraints
• Test all of your methods in your main the same way you did in C#.
• Because C++ does not have properties, utilize getter methods.
• You must not have memory leaks. Every node in the linked list must be freed.
• All methods defined in your source file must have its header in the header file (.h).
• C++ uses camelCase. Name variables and methods using camelCase. Classes should be named
with PascelCase. See the tips for help.
• If a method will not affect the state of the object, mark the method as constant.
